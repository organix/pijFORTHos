Frame Buffer Readme

Obsolete code now using uspi lib for framebuffer

This is a work in progress
words added:
SETFB
SHOW (y,x,ch - )

Variables added
SCREENX
SCREENY
SCREENDEPTH
FG_COLOUR
BG_COLOUR

SETFB reads the values in the SCREENX,SCREENY,SCREENDEPTH (defaults = 1024,768,16)
and initialise the frame buffer - via a call to the GPU

SHOW takes 3 values from the stack, the location on the screen to write to in char from top left and the char to write

10 10 42 SHOW should put a star on the screen in the default white on blue
